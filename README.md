# RE-SWC Firmware

This repo contains the Rotary Encoder - Steering Wheel Controller firmware.

## Requirements

- PlatformIO - I like running it as an extension in VSCode
- [JTAG2UPDI programmer](https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi) - you can make one with an Arduino Nano
- RE-SWC Controller PCB
